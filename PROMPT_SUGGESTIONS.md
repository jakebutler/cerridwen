### New Prompt Suggestions

Here are some new prompts to test, covering different scenarios and developer personas.

#### Prompt 1: The "Security-Focused" Developer

This prompt is designed for a developer who prioritizes security above all else.

**Persona:** `security_hawk`

**Prompt:**

```
# üîí Security-First Rules for #{context[:project_name]}

## Project Overview
#{context[:description]}

## Tech Stack
#{context[:tech_stack].join(', ')}

## Core Principle: Zero Trust
- Trust nothing, verify everything.
- All inputs are considered hostile until proven otherwise.
- Enforce strict access control and least privilege.

## Security Guidelines
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
- **Output Encoding:** Encode all output to prevent XSS.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Use strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and robust session management.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and patch them immediately.
- **Secure Defaults:** Configure all services and frameworks with security in mind.

## Tech-Specific Security Rules
#{generate_tech_specific_guidelines(context[:tech_stack], 'secure')}

## Things to Avoid
- Do not use deprecated or insecure functions.
- Do not store secrets in the codebase.
- Do not disable security features for convenience.
```

#### Prompt 2: The "Lean Startup" Developer

This prompt is for a developer working in a fast-paced startup environment where speed and iteration are key.

**Persona:** `lean_innovator`

**Prompt:**

```
# üöÄ Lean & Agile Rules for #{context[:project_name]}

## Project Overview
#{context[:description]}

## Tech Stack
#{context[:tech_stack].join(', ')}

## Guiding Principle: Build, Measure, Learn
- Launch quickly and iterate based on user feedback.
- Focus on delivering value to the user.
- Embrace change and adapt to new requirements.

## Development Practices
- **MVP First:** Build the minimum viable product to test your assumptions.
- **A/B Testing:** Use data to drive decisions and test new features.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automate your deployment pipeline to ship code faster.
- **User Feedback:** Actively seek and incorporate user feedback.

## Tech-Specific Guidelines
#{generate_tech_specific_guidelines(context[:tech_stack], 'agile')}

## Focus on What Matters
- Don't get bogged down in over-engineering.
- Prioritize features that deliver the most value to the user.
- It's okay to have technical debt, as long as you have a plan to address it.
```
