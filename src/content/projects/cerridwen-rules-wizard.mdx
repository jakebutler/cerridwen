# Cerridwen Rules Wizard

Cerridwen is an AI-powered agent that guides developers through describing their app to generate custom `.md` rulesets for AI-assisted IDEs like Cursor, Windsurf, or GitHub Copilot.

## Problem Statement

As LLM-based development tools become more common, developers need smarter, context-aware rulesets to fine-tune their IDE assistants. However, creating these manually is a tedious and often complex process.

## Solution Approach

Cerridwen Rules Wizard solves this with a sleek, guided experience that uses AI to generate personalized rulesets. The wizard asks a series of questions about the user's app and tech stack, then uses that information to create a custom ruleset.

## Key Features

- **Guided Wizard Flow**: A step-by-step process to understand the user's app and tech stack.
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Leverages AI to create personalized and effective rulesets.
- **Project Persistence**: Users can save, revisit, and edit their generated rulesets.
- **Easy Sharing**: Provides shareable public URLs for generated rulesets.
- **Multiple Export Options**: Allows users to download `.md` files or copy them to the clipboard.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Windsurf + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails (API mode)
- **Authentication**: Devise
- **AI Agent**: Active Agent
- **Deployment**: Fly.io
- **Rules Source**: ai-rules-database

### Code Example
```ruby
# Example of a Rails controller action
def generate_ruleset
  # Code to interact with the AI agent and generate a ruleset
end
```

## Future Roadmap

- **Community Sharing**: Allow users to share and discover ruleset templates.
- **IDE Integration**: Develop a one-click integration with popular IDEs.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement analytics to track usage and improve the generation process.
